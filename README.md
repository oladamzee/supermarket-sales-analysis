## 
INSIGHT
1. Atlanta Sales Dynamics & By generating considerable total revenues, Atlanta is one of the cities with the lowest number of products ordered. This disparity is due to Atlanta having the highest average     product prices, which results in significant revenue despite low sales volume.
2.  Sales and profit trends from January to December 2019 were inconsistent. The year began with decreased sales in January, which gradually increased through April. The decrease began in May and lasted       until September. Sales and profits peaked in December, following a steep rising trend that began in October.
3.  Revenue vs. Profit Disparity E: In 2019, there was a considerable monthly difference between total sales (revenue) and total profit. The average profit margin was 25% of revenue, while no month in         2019 had a profit margin of 50% or more.
